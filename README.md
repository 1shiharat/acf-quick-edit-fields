ACF QuickEdit Fields
====================

WordPress plugin which extends the funtionality of the Advanced Custom Fields Plugin (Pro, Version 5+).
http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/

Show Advanced Custom Fields in post list table.
Edit field values in Quick Edit and / or Bulk edit.

Proofed to work with ACF Pro 5.x.
Will cause a fatal error when used with ACF Free (version 4.x).

Developers note
---------------
This plugin is still a stub. I am not quite sure if I will continue develping it.
If you encounter an issue or wish for a certain feature, please do not ask me to 
fix it for you. I will not, but I would really appreciate when you fix it youself 
and send me a pull request.

ToDo:
-----
 - [ ] Code Docs
 - [ ] Plugin localization
 - [ ] Nice Format for `color_picker` and `date_picker` fields
