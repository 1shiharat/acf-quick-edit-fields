ACF QuickEdit Fields
====================

WordPress plugin which extends the functionality of the Advanced Custom Fields Plugin (Pro, Version 5+).  
http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/

Features
--------
 - Show ACF field values in List views  
   [Supported ACF Fields](https://github.com/mcguffin/acf-quick-edit-fields/wiki/Supported-ACF-Fields).
 - Supports Post, Term and User list tables
 - Scalar Columns (Like Text, Number, ...) are sortable  
   (See [Note](#known-issues))
 - Edit ACF Field values in Quick edit and Bulk edit

Compatibility
-------------
 - Requeres ACF Pro 5.x (ACF Free 4.x wonâ€™t work)
 - Requires at least PHP 5.3+
 - Tested with WordPress up to 4.9.1
 - Requires at least WP 4.7

Docs
----

A note on sortable Columns: Sorting works over a meta query. As a result, items
with no ACF-Value will disappear from the list. To adjust or suppress sortability
for a specific field use `acf_quick_edit_sortable_column_{$field_name}` filter.


Installation
------------

 - Download `acf-quick-edit-fields.zip` from the [releases](../../releases/latest) tab.
 - Install it like a regular WordPress plugin.
 - As long as the plugin is active it will check for Updates here on GitHub.
